# home_heatlhcare_quality
Home health agencies play a critical role in patient recovery and long-term care. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) provides performance data for these agencies, including quality ratings and patient outcome measures.

## Installation
The code can be opened in a Jupyter Notebook and requires Python 3.x.

## Project Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing state‑level home care data to identify the key factors that influence star ratings. The analysis began with exploratory data examination using the HH_State_Oct2025.csv file. The analysis was performed to better understand:

1.  Can we develop a reliable model to predict star ratings based on patient improvement measures?
2.  What are the key factors within patient improvement metrics that most strongly influence star ratings?
3.  If flu shot compliance is increased by 10%, what impact would that have on star ratings, and in which states should we prioritize this initiative?

## File Descriptions

The following files are provided to support the analysis:

HH_State_Oct2025.csv – A CSV file containing data on home health quality and associated measurement metrics. The answers to the questions above are based on this dataset.
README.d – A documentation file that includes all necessary instructions and details required to run the analysis.
home_healthcare_quality.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook source file containing the code for performing the analysis. It can be opened in Jupyter Notebook and requires Python 3.x.
home_healthcare_quality.py – A Python script containing the same analysis code. It can be executed using Python 3.x.
